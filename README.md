 Top-Down Robot Physics Puzzle Game

*Getting from A to B with Xy!*\
Take control of Xy the Robot, as you rotate yourself around puzzling level design!
Use your arms to rotate about *Pegs* placed around the level to either help you, or distract you from getting to the final goal!
Collect *Keys* to unlock *Doors* of that colour and avoid those pesky *Conveyor Blocks* that try to get in your way!
And make sure not to wander too far, or the orange *Kill Blocks* might send you back to the start of the level!

Art Style:
- Simple
- Tiled Assets
- Clear Colour Meanings
- Fun Background

Controls:
- Left Mouse Button: Toggle the Pegs on and off (On by default)

Known Bugs:
- Level 2 ends in an infinite loop of replaying level 2, no proper end.
- If Xy (Player) drifts off into the void, they will not die, you will need to return to the main menu using the Escape Key.
